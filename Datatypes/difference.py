# Difference between list, tuple, set and dict

# list and tuple are ordered collection
# set and dict are unordered collection

# list and set are mutable
# tuple is immutable
# dict is mutable but keys are immutable and values are mutable

# list and dict support indexing and slicing
# tuple supports indexing and slicing
# set doesnt support indexing and slicing

# list and tuple can have duplicate elements
# set and dict can not have duplicate elements
# dict support duplicate values but not duplicate keys

# list and tuple can have any data type as element
# set support only int, float, str, complex, boolean, tuple as element
# dict key can be int, float, str, complex, boolean, tuple values can be any data type

# list and tuple support concatenation and repetition
# set and dict doesnt support concatenation and repetition
# list and dict support membership operator
# tuple supports membership operator

# set update() method is similar to list extend() method but not same as list append() method because append() method adds single element at the end of the list where as update() method adds multiple elements at once from iterable data types like list, tuple, set, dict, str
# dict update() method is similar to list extend() method but not same as list append() method because append() method adds single element at the end of the list where as update() method adds key-value pairs from another dictionary
